# E-Commerce-Website

Django/Python

A fake e-commerce website using Django. I incorporated several back-end topics into the project which I had planned to learn: User Authentication and sign-in, Checkout option using dummy PayPal accounts, API requests (PayPal integration), Cookies usage for personal data storage, HTTP requests and error handling, Security checks (preventing data from being manipulated from the front-end), Database usage through models, The MVT Structure and more. It starts at the home page, getting fake data from internal files. Pages provide more information on each item upon clicking on said item, and can be added to the cart. The cart features continuously updating figures to display costs and quantities, and can be paid for with a fake paypal account using the paypal API. It also detects whether shipping information is necessary in the order by seeing if a user is signed in, and also if the items bought are physical or digital.

I followed along with a course on YouTube as my beginning steps towards utilising the framework, learning the practical standards of using Django throughout, like database management and data requests from various API sources.
