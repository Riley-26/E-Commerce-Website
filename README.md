# E-Commerce-Website
A fake e-commerce website using Django. I followed along with a course on YouTube as my beginning steps towards utilising the framework, learning the practical standards of using Django throughout. Incorporated several back-end topics into the project which I had planned to learn:
User Authentication and sign-in
Checkout option using dummy PayPal accounts
API requests (PayPal integration)
Cookies usage for personal data storage
HTTP requests and error handling
Security checks (preventing data from being manipulated from the front-end)
Database usage through models
The MVT Structure
